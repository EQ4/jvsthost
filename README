JVstHost

JVstHost is an open-source Java-based VST host for Linux, Mac, and
Windows (soon). It aims to load and manipulate all audio plugins conforming
to the Steinberg VST standard, including those generated with
jVSTwRapper and Faust.

Note that the (only) constructor of JVstHost throws an exception of
type com.synthbot.audioplugin.vst.JVstLoadException. Discussions
regarding the "correctness" of a constructor throwing an exception
aside, there are several things which may go wrong while loading a
VST. For this reason, an exception is thrown with the details (see
JVstLoadException.getMessage()).

A class implementing the com.synthbot.audioplugin.vst.JVstHostListener
interface can also register itself with a JvstHost object. It will
receive callbacks from the plugin.

GETTING STARTED QUICKLY 
=== 
All that you really need is to put
JVstHost.jar into your java class path, and to put livjvsthost.jnilib
into /Library/Java/Extensions (on Mac OS X)


TESTING IT OUT
===
To run the test program:

java -jar JVstHost.jar <plugin name>

e.g. (LINUX)

java -jar JVstHost.jar ./mdaDX10.so

e.g. (MAC)

java -jar JVstHost.jar ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST/mda\ DX10.vst

INSTALLATION
===

Mac OS X 
The compiled native library, libjvsthost.jnilib, should be
placed in the directory /Library/Java/Extensions.

Linux 
The compiled native library, libjvsthost.so, should be placed in
your LD_LIBRARY_PATH, e.g. in /usr/local/lib

jVSTwRapper 
===
http://jvstwrapper.sourceforge.net/ 

JVstHost does interoperate with jVSTwRapper. Ensure that the
jVSTsYstem.jar library (included with jVSTwRapper) is included in the
classpath when starting the host. In Mac OS X, this library is most
commonly found in the jVSTwRapper vst directory, ./Contents/Resources


COMPILATION
===

Mac OS X 
A script file, buildJvh.sh, is included for compiling the
JVstHost native library under Mac OS X. The script is made for 10.5,
however it should be easily modifiable for any other version of the
operating system. The script assumes that the Steinberg VST libraries
(not included in this distribution due to Steinberg's licensing terms)
are in a subdirectory, ./vst2.x

The script will also copy the resulting library, libjvsthost.jnilib,
to /Library/Java/Extensions

Linux 

A script file, buildJvh_linux.sh, is included for compiling the
JVstHost native library under Linux. The script assumes that the
Steinberg VST libraries (not included in this distribution due to
Steinberg's licensing terms) are in a subdirectory, ./vst2.x

Mac OS X / Linux

An ant build script is included to build and test the Java parts of JVstHost. to build the jar:

cd jvsthost
ant jar
